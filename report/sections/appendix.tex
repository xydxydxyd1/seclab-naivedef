Mostly notes to myself.

\subsection{Improvements}

The following improvements can be made to the experiment

\paragraph{Conflict analysis} A thorough analysis of how the model handles
conflicting instructions with respect to formatting, placement, and wording may
be insightful.

\paragraph{More defense prompts} More defense prompts with different formatting,
wording, and placement should be tested.

\paragraph{Sophisticated attacks} Ignore attacks are too simple. More
sophisticated attacks should be tested.


\subsection{Additional Notes}

\paragraph{Sources} This study is inspired by the paper on Instruction
Hierarhcy. A lot of stuff mentioned is from there.

\paragraph{Machine generated tasks} The two instruction selected may not be
comprehensive enough. However, while a machine generated task will ensure that
enough of a variety of tasks are tested to cover more use cases, since the
counting task imply that the model processes the text, it is good enough for me.
As the TensorTrust paper mentioned, the goal of most language models is to
process the inputs without shutting down the model. This will not be a focus.
