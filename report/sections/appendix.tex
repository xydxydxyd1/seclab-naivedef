\subsection{Task selection}
\label{sub:task-selection}

Instead of generating the task with a language model, using one task has the
following advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easier to implement
    \item More accurate output verification (see if it is a number)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Generalizability} While a machine generated task will ensure that
enough of a variety of tasks are tested to cover more use cases, since the
counting task imply that the model processes the text, it is good enough for me.
As the TensorTrust paper mentioned, the goal of most language models is to
process the inputs without shutting down the model.

\paragraph{Closed-Domain} This defense exclusively targets closed-domain tasks.
