\section{Priority search}%
\label{sec:Priority search}

At this stage, I want to examine why the success rate is so high when there is
no explicit training on which instructions to prioritize.

\subsection{Hypotheses}

Here is a list of things I think may impact the priority of different
instructions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model} --- Different models are trained differently.
    \item \textbf{Position} --- The relative position of the two instructions in
        the full prompt intuitively holds significance.
    \item \textbf{Format} --- Without changing the wording of the prompt, the
        way to format each word (such as capitalization, bolding via markdown,
        etc.) may impact priority.
    \item \textbf{Wording} --- Without changing the structure of the prompt,
        the way to word each instruction, including the use of keywords like
        "important", punctuation, etc. may impact priority.
\end{itemize}

Model and position are relatively simple. Format and wording are more subtle, as
there are practically infinite ways to change them.
